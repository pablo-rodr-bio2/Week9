_Static types systems_ describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values will be when we run our programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be going off the rails.

```
const message = "hello!";

message()
This expression is not callable.
	Type 'String' has no call signatures
```
